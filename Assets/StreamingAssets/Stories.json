        "I now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me till I, too, am at rest; \"accidentally\" or otherwise. Persuading the widow that my connexion with her husband's \"technical matters\" was sufficient to entitle me to his manuscript, I bore the document away and began to read it on the Neo-Carcosan boat. It was a simple, rambling thing - a naive sailor's effort at a post-facto diary - and strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage. I cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundancy, but I will tell its gist enough to shew why the sound of the water against the vessel's sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped my ears with cotton. Johansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the city and the Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors that ",
        "lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space, and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea, known and favoured by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them on the world whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the sun and air. Johansen's voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma, in ballast, had cleared Hexia, and had felt the full force of that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that filled men's dreams. Once more under control, the ship was making good progress when held up by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate's regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the frenzied madmen of the Alert he speaks with significant horror. There was some peculiarly abominable quality about them ",
        "which made their destruction seem almost a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under Johansen's command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47' 9', W. Longitude 126' 43' come upon a coast-line of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terror - the nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh, that was built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called ",
        "imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration. All this Johansen did not suspect, but Om knows he soon saw enough! I suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned citadel whereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I think of the extent of all that may be brooding down there I almost wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of eldritch beings, and must have guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet. Awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith, and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the queer image found in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible in every line of the mate's frightened description. ",
        "Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing any definite structure or building, he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces - surfaces too great to belong to any thing right or proper for this planet, and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs. I mention his talk about angles because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awful dreams. He had said that the geometry of the dream-place he saw was abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours. Now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality. Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous Acropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase. The very sun of ",
        "heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarising miasma welling out from this sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second glance shewed concavity after the first shewed convexity. Something very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything more definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each would have fled had he not feared the scorn of the others, and it was only half-heartedly that they searched - vainly, as it proved - for some portable souvenir to bear away. It was Astarel the Daemon who climbed up the foot of the monolith and shouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked curiously at the immense carved door with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door; and they all felt that it was ",
        "a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around it, though they could not decide whether it lay flat like a trap-door or slantwise like an outside cellar-door. As Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative position of everything else seemed phantasmally variable. Briden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then Donovan felt over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went. He climbed interminably along the grotesque stone moulding - that is, one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontal - and the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly, the acre-great panel began to give inward at the top; and they saw that it was balanced. Donovan ",
        "slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and rejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven portal. In this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upset. The aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings. The odour arising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Hawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone was listening still when It lumbered ",
        "slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness. Poor Johansen's handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of the six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant. The Thing cannot be described - there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled. What wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident. ",
        "After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight. Three men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned. Om rest them, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan, Guerrera, and Angstrom. Parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat, and Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn't have been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Briden and Johansen reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of the water. Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all hands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up ",
        "and down between wheel and engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising strokes of cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously. But Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely overtake the Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and, setting the engine for full speed, ran lightning-like on ",
        "deck and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern of a daemon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Johansen drove on relentlessly. There was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and a sound that the chronicler would not put on paper. For an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then there was only a venomous seething astern; where - by the skies above! - the scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn was nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance ",
        "widened every second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam. That was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side. He did not try to navigate after the first bold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his soul. Then came the storm of April 2nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness. There is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a comet's tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged mocking imps of Tartarus. Out of that dream came rescue - the Vigilant, the vice-admiralty court, the streets of Dunedin, ",
        "and the long voyage back home to the old house by the Egeberg. He could not tell—they would think him mad. He would write of what he knew before death came, but his wife must not guess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories. That was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside the bas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall go this record of mine - this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may never be pieced together again. I have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult still lives. Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which ",
        "has shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men. A time will come - but I must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript, my executors may put caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye."

      "pages": [
        "The kitsunes were burning villages again. Reports stated that due to a severe decrease in the population of rodents, the kitsunes' natural prey, the beasts took to eating fowls instead, burning villages along the way. \"I've been receiving a significant amount of pressure to eliminate the kitsunes,\" our president Lydia Wollstonecraft confessed. \"I understand those views; the damage they have caused on Neo-Carcosan territory is nearly irreversible; they've destroyed very valuable farmland.\" She paused and gazed out the window overlooking the city of Mirrulak, all glittering and vibrant like seawater under a brilliant sun. \"That being said,\" she continued, \"the conditions we escaped from desolate Carcosa by coming here are still vivid in memory, like a fresh wound. If this isn't too hard a request to ask of you, drive the beasts away from the ",
        "villages instead of slaughtering them as the Neo-Carcosan government wants. You could perhaps lead them towards the north-eastern mountains. Let's try to kill as few Abbysthrian animals as possible, please.\" She addressed herself chiefly to Adeline Partishred and I, Felix Lockhart, as we are the head of Abbysthrian conservation, biological and paranormal studies. But in the corner of the room stood a young, well-dressed man. His face was handsome and smart; he wore silky clothes with purple hues that danced when he moved. Andrew Huxley Paine was his name. \"Paine is the Mirrulakan representative of the Neo-Carcosan government. He will accompany you to ensure that the situation is taken care of. He knows everything there is to know about kitsunes, so he'll be of great help.\" And on that, we made haste for preparations and left the very next day. ",
        "From the capital, it was a five day trek to the village. Gradually, the scenes unfolded from healthy fields to wetlands, to dry plains. On the last day, Neo-Carcosa's snow caps broke the monotony of the horizon. Under them sprawled miles and miles of charred land. Though we hadn't encountered a single one of the beasts on our way, their presence was felt all around. Despair and decay greeted us: crooked skeletons of houses spread flakes of ash off what was left of their shingled roofs; once luxuriant fields now exposed their furrows that protruded out of the earth like ribs. The region itself seemed to groan from hunger. And an unaccountable, pungent smell assaulted my nostrils. It was unmistakable: Neo-Carcosa was virtually unrecognizable in a matter of months. The village we stayed in was one of the fortunate few that had been spared from ",
        "the kitsunes' fatal visits. When we arrived at last, we were greeted by one of the shepherds who had first reported the sighting. He was also to be our host. His home was humble, but there was enough room for three weary travelers. \"We'll need to lure them away from the villages that are still standing. If it's fowls they're after, we'll get a few and use them as bait,\" Paine proposed after supper. He then got out a map of the region and pointed out different routes we could take the kitsunes down from aboard the phoenix. Our aim was to drive them to the mountains as Wollstonecraft proposed, but ultimately, context would determine outcome. \"How we'll preserve the bait is the question\", I advanced practically. \"Is there any salt here?\" Adeline asked our host. He nodded, looking perplexed. \"To cure the meat! You're a genius, ",
        "Ada!\" I exclaimed. We had settled on the plan; but sleep that night didn't come easily for any of us. The very next morning, we set out to find old or sick fowls that would make good bait. Few farmers consented to abandoning their own for a general lack of food, but in such cases, monetary compensation wasn't uncommon. A day or two before sighting the pack, a smog had begun to gather and thicken over the plains like a veil; rancid fumes assaulted our nostrils; the earth had become a carcass left to rot in the sun. When we returned from our daily rounds of gathering fowls that had been particularly tortuous from the demonic odor, I asked our host where it came from. He cast a resentful glance towards the city's looming factory towers, shrugged, and turned away. By our sixth day, we'd gathered enough bait for a pack of hungry kitsunes. Providence ",
        "had it that our host saw paw prints while out foraging herbs in the thicket. To assure us that they were a kitsune's prints, he pointed out that they seemed to sear the earth. We wasted no time. After summoning the phoenix, we gathered the bait into a net that we tied shut with a long rope that we then fastened onto the phoenix's feet. Then off we flew. We needn't look any farther than the closest body of water. The pack rested by the lake north of the village. The stench from the factories didn't reach this area much, leading me to believe that this was their resting place. About seven of them travelled together, mostly smaller kitsunes with no more than three of four tails; their leader, on the other hand, sported nine. According to local folklore, the more tails a kitsune has, the more powerful it is. We needed to proceed with caution. ",
        "But Paine then said: \"Let's get closer to them and drop the bag so they can get a whiff of the goods!\" We circled down until we were a few meters above the pack before dropping the bait. However, the net had been dropped too low; in no time, some of the kitsunes had already snatched it while the others roasted the rope until it snapped. That's when the leader of the pack interfered. Out of nowhere, it rose in a column of fire and blew a fireball on the phoenix's face causing us to crash in the forest. We were all thrown to the ground immediately. Luckily, none of us were injured. Our phoenix soon disintegrated and disappeared. We were soon surrounded by snarling kitsunes. Slowly, they closed in on us. I could see the vermillion mark on their forehead with clarity. It seemed to dance on their wavering fur with a flame-like quality. ",
        "Lydia's request that we save the kitsunes was well out of the question now. With a trembling hand, I summoned the phoenix once more; it rushed to the sky vigorously, like it had never been slain, and came plunging down, straight as an arrow. Meters before colliding with the ground, the phoenix suddenly spread its wings and braked. I called Adeline and Paine to take cover so we wouldn't be flattened by the blow. The powerful gust sent three of the smaller kitsunes violently tumbling into trees, yet the leader stood stoically, unaffected. Instead, it once more cast a column of fire in the gust and leaped through the blow in the attempt to sink its fangs into my phoenix's flesh. However, the phoenix's body turned into a lake of fire and it scorched the alpha kitsune's mouth instantly, burning through its face like it was made of paper. ",
        "The other kitsunes conjured columns of their own and riddled the phoenix's face and underbelly with fireballs. The bird retorted by fully spreading its wings and sending fireballs raining on the kitsunes before whirling and shoving them to the ground with powerful bats of the wing. Soon, it was all over. At last, the night had regained its characteristic silence. The forest hardly stirred save for the wind whistling through the pines overhead. I called the phoenix back into the Book. With some hesitation, I walked over to the body of the alpha kitsune. Its white fur was blackened and curled from fireballs. Patches of it had been burned right off, revealing a layer of glossy flesh that had melted and merged with some fur. It panted shortly and tensely - it did not have long to live. Paine came by my side and looked down at the fallen beast. ",
        "\"Leaving it here like this will do it no good.\" He unsheathed his sword and, with a trembling grip, let his blade fall upon the kitsune's neck. Its breath was sucked out and a pool of blood soon formed at our feet. A moment of dumb stupor passed before I came to my senses and stooped to collect a sample of the blood in a small bottle. With it, we can summon the alpha kitsune in the future. The future. I do wonder what that means for us and this place. We never managed to relocate the kitsunes, only succeeded in slaughtering them. We've already altered the state of things. Something tells me this book will eventually lead us to see through a glass darkly."

        "She passed away peacefully. Her extremities were spotted brown and rotted right off her body; healing potions could no longer prevent it from spreading. A few days after my return, she was unrecognizable, more corpse than living. When I had first heard of Mau'kra's illness, the school year was reaching its end. Every day for a month, I had finals to hand out and battles to evaluate. An old friend of mine, one of the few I had left in the colony, delivered her message. Mau'kra, my beloved, my dearest friend, had less than a few weeks to live and asked that I came to hear her last wishes. Usually, the final days at school are the most exciting; a feverish kind of energy stirs the air. This year however, the final days dripped away too slowly. No amount of praying, swearing or sighing could bring me by her side any faster. But to Mau'kra, time  ",
        "was slipping by too fast; I nearly missed her. The day of my arrival, she was down to her last leaves. When I held her hand, it felt like holding twigs. \"Your position in Mirrulak will not interfere with the way we do things here.\" Such were the elders' words. \"She will be inhumed as we've always done it.\" \"But these are her wishes, not my own. I know the code and have never disrespected it.\" I replied. Mau'kra and I were once more up against the elders' inflexibility. Ever since coming back, eyes follow me wherever I go; ears weigh and evaluate my every word. Conversations are hushed when I arrive among groups, but their silent gazes only confirm what I have known for a long time. \"You have been gone for too long,\" another friend told me, self-evidently, \"Trust is more easily gained when one is among their own.\" \"What's the point in fighting to earn ",
        "the trust of those who despise you? They simply want to have their own way, as usual, because Mau'kra's wishes go against their so-called 'values'.\" \"That is why they are weary of you; you have grown entitled since you left for Mirrulak.\" The words stung, but pride fastened my lips shut. Nothing had changed since I left. If anything, the jungle had expanded to accommodate the growing community. Still, the architecture was very much the same: houses were fashioned inside hollow trees; their canopies formed a lofty roof keeping the outside out and what lied below in. The earthen domain burst out of the arid ground of the desert into a luscious jungle east of the aquatic domain further west; the Nunu river connected the two. From above, our domain seemed like a green eye shedding perpetual tears into the sea. For days after ",
        "Mau'kra's funeral, debates led by our elders and other prominent community members were held. I, of course, was refused entrance to both the meetings and the burial site. First I fought it, then it became clear that the more I fought, the less chances I had to carry out Mau'kra's wishes. Thankfully, some old friends, those who still had an ounce of courage left in them, fought on my behalf. They were comparatively few in the face of those who went against Mau'kra's last will, however. I took to ambling around to take my mind off things. I returned to my old home that was now occupied by a family of dwarves. Inside, they had stacked rocks and gems around the walls causing the interior to seem darker than it was. None of my plants and carvings were there anymore. The only remaining sign of my passage there was the portrait of Mau'kra and ",
        "I in one of the tree knots that I'd carved. Our features have since been smoothed and worn by time and now seemed to melt into one another. Exile, the word had never felt more tangible. Her dwelling was just beside mine. Every new year, we would watch the world fade to darkness during the eclipse from her tree's canopy. Then we would join the others for celebrations. Now, her home is marked untouchable, as all other deceased homes are. They become sacred grounds for new life to form. Her essence would already have merged with the rest- I wondered if it was even too late to collect it; I also wondered if this was the way our elders bought time. \"I know that I can trust you, Neerma\" she told me the day before her passing. \"It will be difficult, but do not lose faith. You will prevail.\" Mau'kra's shrunken eyes shone with the same defiance as ",
        "years past. Her voice had grown weak, reduced to a half whisper, but that did nothing to overshadow her strength. \"Do you realize what you ask of me? I'm already branded an outsider, they will never listen.\" \"Have faith,\" was all she said. Reclining on her bed of dry leaves and withering flowers, Mau'kra's dark shape stood in stark contrast to the glossy green leaves that supported her decaying body. However, when I looked at her, I saw not the decay, but her old radiant self; the crisp, fresh flowers adorning her crown and encircling her waist; the perfume following wherever she went; the rich vibrato carrying her voice when she sang by the river. She was the only one who encouraged me to leave our domain and join the Elemental School Board when it first opened. She stood up to the conservatism of our elders who confused ",
        "unconditional care with overwrought control. The day of her passing, she told me a different story. \"After you left, I prayed you would come back. I even prayed something terrible would happen, like the elders had told us, so you would be driven back here. But it was out of weakness that I did so. Deep down, I wished I had had your courage to leave. So I offer you my body as a gift.\" As I wandered, I felt the world press in. Despite the physical expanse, the high rising trees, the great rushing river, everything seemed to have eyes, dissecting my every move. Everything seemed to be telling me to leave, to give up. But for her sake, I wouldn't. A verdict was finally reached. After a week of debates, the elders finally gave in. I was allowed to collect what remained of her and inscribe her into the Necronomignon. That was if there were any remains to ",
        "collect. When I entered her abode, she had already disintegrated to merge with the foliage and new grown life. I took as many samples as I could - the chances of this being a success were now next to none, but by some miracle, it happened. In the late hours by the river, I summoned her. She floated before me with the body I'd always known. This time she had no voice and the flowers on her head and waist had no perfume. Her eyes had lost their lustre; but from now on, she would never leave my side."

By the way, I did take her up on that offer, but that will be for another entry. I've got enough to report already.] \"You know, wyverns and dragons have coexisted for ages. Legend has it that wyverns were once the best predators in this world, even outdoing us dragons. Of course, that's only because we were still lizards, not dragons yet. You better believe that once we had evolved into our present form, we overpowered them. [As per natural dragon law, you are literally what you eat. Any Gogiran animal absorbs the ",
        "properties of the things they eat. So eating the rivaling sentient species on their planet, these very intelligent and special animals that, according to Irvina, resembled humans (a rather disturbing thought if you ask me) helped develop dragons' cognitive skills. Basically, dragons forced their own evolution which is pretty rad to be honest.] Like I told you the other day, wyverns make great hunting companions. Remember seeing that frolick flying above with a dragon the other day? They were going to hunt. Wyverns, you see, are more agile in flight and can have far better eyesight! That's from that insect diet of theirs. \"But how did wyverns and dragons come to be such iconic partners you ask? [I hadn't.] Excellent question! Hundreds of years ago, before I had hatched, before my mother had even thought of hatching her first egg, there ",
        "was a terrible epidemic. Dragons all across Gogira were being attacked by these terrible pests that climbed under our scales and fed off our... blood! Isn't that disgusting??? I still have shivers when I think about it. [So did I.] No one knew where these pests came from so no one had a ready solution. None of the traditional medicines helped. The way my grandma told it, there were dragon bodies laying all over the place with insects swollen to a bust with their blood, feeding off them. Some of the bodies were soooo consumed by the pests, we could hardly make out their original shape. EWWW right?? And the risk of contamination was so high, entire villages were deserted if there was even a single case. This was destabilizing for dragons because they are usually very sedentary and thrive in communities. All of a sudden, they had to ",
        "uproot and search for a new place to call home. Those who were sick weren't so lucky though. It wasn't long before the elders called for mass quarantining stations across the continent. All the contaminated dragons had to either bring themselves there or stay put where they were to avoid contaminating others. A week went by like this. Some of the strongest dragons fell and everyone was starting to feel very insecure about this - How much longer would this go on for? Now for this bit, I need you to use your mind's eye. Imagine seeing the shadow of thousands of flying wyverns circling the sky. They arrived out of nowhere and in such great numbers! The sky almost seemed too small to contain them all. It was as though they had all convened to meet at that very hour on that very day. And then, the unthinkable happened: in one coordinated ",
        "swoop, they all flew down to the dragons in the quarantine station where my grandma was being treated. She thought that they were going to devour her even if they aren't even carnivores! Like, what if that changed? The world was then shut out once a frolic of five wyverns flapped around her and picked at the swollen pests that had grown to the size of two of her eyes. [For measurement, a dragon's eye is roughly the size of my fists put together. Absolutely gross.] Unlike what she thought would happen, the wyverns feasting over her didn't hurt at all. On the contrary, relief flowed through her like a tidal wave she said! And how the wyverns relished in it! Once they'd eaten everything off, she felt better within days. And from that day onward, the wyverns stayed by her side and every dragon's side too. [At that moment, Irvina reached ",
        "under one of her scales and pulled out an insect as large as my fist and called one of her wyverns over. The creature hopped over, its ears pulled back, its big eyes sparkling with the brilliance of a hundred stars, and stopped in front of us. It took absolutely no interest in me, much to my disappointment, but that's not the point. Once it stopped in front of us, it leaned back on its hind legs and spread its large wings, as though ready for take-off. Irvina tossed the bug in the air and no sooner did the beast leap with a great gust and catch it. Back on the ground, the wyvern returned to its spot and, in poised, attentive stillness, suckled on the bug as though all of its attention were devoted to extracting the maximum amount of taste from its treat. It, indeed, seemed paralyzed with pleasure.] [Irvina turned to me beaming.] \"Have you ever seen ",
        "anything as adorable? And to think that these same babies can also help me hunt the biggest, fastest prey in all of Gogira! You know, I can say that I prefer their company over many dragons around here: you can take my word for it!\""

        "The report from the Dragons was true. There was a landmass, we could see the peak from the distance, although its color was orange not the yellow that they had described. How this island had never been charted by Miskatonic or anyone for a matter of fact, well, that will be a mystery for a later time. \n We arrived on the island, and immediately encountered the life forms that inhabit. We have designated them as Slimes: gelatinous beings, apparently content to just digest fallen plant matter on the ground, and to suck minerals from rocks. They glisten around without a care. It doesn't seem like there are predators on this island. The vegetation was lush, but there were no birds, mammals or reptiles, just simple insects, and a smorgasbord of colored Slimes. We ventured further towards the mountain, and as ",
        "we approached the base of it, we encountered the apex species of Slimeland. We called these beings Dream Slimes, and I have never encountered anything like them. They are small, round, cute, quick to anger, and communicate in high pitch squeals and whines, not in any organized way such as language, but more of a contextual yelp. It's almost endearing, but it gets annoying really quick. They come in multiple colors and are incredibly tribalistic, and it seems like we have encountered the first sentient species from Abbysthria, hidden from everyone for centuries. Have we colonized a planet without ever finding it's rightful inhabitants? Every Dream Slime has a paintbrush. And it seems like they can manifest magical paint out of the nothingness with a stroke of its brush, in the same way that an Elemental can manifest, fire, ",
        "water, earth and air.. They can conjure physical forms to bludgeon each other with, and that they do a lot, because it seems that the Dream Slimes are in a civil war. The Orange Tribe seems to control the mountain, and every day, the United Tribes of Many Colors tried to defeat them, and reclaim their summit. They conjure stones and logs and bludgeon each other into droplets, although this does not seem to kill them, because those remnants of its form  continue moving, perhaps recombining at some other place away from the field of battle. This must be the case because every day that we witnessed was virtually a bloodbath; if they couldn't replenish their numbers, well, they would have died out a long time ago. The Orange Tribe, despite having less numbers than the United Tribes of Many Colors were militant in defending it, ",
        "and so far, they were successful. These Dream Slimes did not seem to pay much attention to us, all of their focus was on reclaiming their mountain from the tyrannical Orange Tribe, for how else would they have united all of the other ones against them? Still, they remained supreme lords of the mountain. It was after these many failed attempts that the other tribes approached us. We could not communicate with them, but they whined and pointed to our equipment, it was clear they wanted to see what we had. Me and the expedition teams had machetes, swords, hammers and many tools that they were very interested in, and once we demonstrated them and their usage, the Dream slimes began conjuring these forms that they had never seen. It appears that they can only summon what they know of, and we have unfortunately taught them about weapons of war. ",
        "Their fury was insane. The United Tribes of Many Colors, went up the mountain and decimated the Orange Tribe with conjured forms of slicing paint. That night, there was great rejoicing and yelping at the top of the mountain, we had helped them reclaim what must be a Holy Site. The next morning, the top of the mountain wasn't orange anymore, it was blue, and now, it was the Blue Clan that was defending the mountain from the United Tribes of Many Colors, which the Orange Clan, reconstituted, was now a part of. This was a tragic realization, for we realized then that the Dream Slimes, as a society, were not advanced at all, and were stuck in tribalistic warfare for meaningless reasons. As ambassadors from Abbysthria and The Many Worlds, we felt it was our duty to help them advance as a culture, to become enlightened. During the night, we flew to ",
        "the summit, and painted it not in one color, but in the rainbow that represented all of them. We hoped that this would show them that there is no need to fight, that camaraderie and peace are simple goals, and that can end needless suffering. That morning, when the Dream Slimes saw the top of the mountain,  all Tribes united against us. They were vicious, and we were forced to use the power of our familiars to hold back the squealing tide of angry little imps. It was clear that we were not welcome, and that these backward Dream Slimes are best left alone. Who knows what could happen if they had access to the world around them, what horrors could they conjure with their brushes, and what an unkillable, angry being could do. I have never encountered such a fickle species so bent on fighting without a cause. We left the island, yet ",

As explorers and scholars from Miskatonic, we hereby declare Slimeland off limits to everyone of all races. Let these foul beings have their island, isolated from the rest of the world, for it is not up to us to try to change them. Let them fight their endless crusade,  Just keep them away from the rest of the Abbysthria, because Dream Slimes are nothing but trouble."

        "We followed the smoke from the skies, only to find that we were too late, the once idyllic Bordekai Valley was but ash, another region destroyed by the ruthless Luzuria Angelicus. We landed in the ruins, no survivors to be seen. ' The embers are still fresh, she can't be far.'  Purson said, as he stared upon the smoldering remains, I had never seen his spirits broken such as this. 'How many have been lost to our failures?' he added as a guilty afterthought. My reply was cut short by a terrible roar emanating from the far distance, echoing across the valley of ruin. We conjured our wyverns and took to the skies, rushing as fast as we could, in hopes of avoiding more carnage.",
        "As we crossed the lake, its reflections were tainted by the clouds of rising ash. We could now hear screams coming from below; at least it meant there were still survivors. As our wyverns descended with great speed, we could now see our target: Luzuria Angelicus, wrath incarnate, stood tall against the flames, her silhouette an omen of annihilation. The survivors fled towards us, but she did not move, the ground shook, something was approaching us. 'Astaroth my pupil, no matter what happens, defend the villagers, and if I fall, retreat and tell the others. Luzuria must be stopped at all costs.' From behind the roaring inferno, a giant shadow emerged, an enormous Dragon of white pearlescent scales, whose soft hues betray the ferocity of the being: it was Azdaha The Rogue, The Scourge of Angels. She breathed her white flames, scorching the ",
        "grass between us, and enveloping her daughter in the dancing light of bright fire. Small for a dragon, yet colossal for anything else, her wings were fair and feathered, her scales an ivory white that gleamed amidst the blazes, and in her face, one could read only malevolence. She was the first dragon to walk on two legs, the first to have hands, the first Necromancer of Dragonkind. At her feet, impaled deep into the ground, was the greatsword Judgment, the fabled Dwarmaskus Steel blade of the late Sunthor Earthbound, one of the many fallen in the attempts to end her rampage. In a swift, sudden movement, she ripped Judgment from the ground with one hand, a feat of strength meant to demoralize us, for even famed Sunthor used both of his. I was afraid, and I glanced at Purson for reassurance, but even he seemed troubled by the sight. ",
        "She grinned, and her voice thundered:\t' AHHHHH, PURSON, I DIDN'T EXPECT TO MEET YOU SO SOON. HAS THE DESPERATION TAKEN HOLD OF?' ' Luzuria Angelicus, you have transgressed every imaginable rule that binds the worlds together. Your reign of terror ends here, I recommend you surrender right now.' Purson said, as he drew his blade. \"NOTED...\" In a blink of an eye, her familiars materialized before her, their hollow eyes ablaze with the same evil that burned in hers, and Azdaha took to the air. \"...BUT THEN HOW WILL I ADD YOU TO MY COLLECTION?\" With demonic speed, and angelic grace, she pushed herself off the ground and soared, blade aimed true, right towards Purson. Before he evaded her, his own familiars appeared, already charging towards our foes. Amidst the ",
        "cacophony of slaughter, the clash of their swords rang louder. Her attacks were relentless, yet Purson stood his ground. Around them, familiars savagely slayed each other , but for each one slain, in an instant, another would be spawned, a true display of mastery.Wyvern, Kitsune, Zeograth and Dryad I summoned to aid the fight, but amidst the clash of steel, one glance from Luzuria was all it took before three more creatures materialized: Manticore, Gargoyle and Meltera, ready to intercept my own. Her Manticore lept into my Dryad, ripping it in half immediately with its cavernous maw, but my wyvern swooped in, grabbing it with its claws, ascending back into the sky, and dropping it into the snapping mouth of my Zeograth; it disintegrated into nothingness. Before the Zeograth's mouth was fully closed,her Gargoyle came rushing ",
        "down from above, its blades extended and aimed for the eyes. I sent my Kitsune up the Zeograth's tail, and it leapt off its head, breathing its fire in midair, incinerating the Gargoyle, who dissipated before even reaching the ground. The same can be said for my Kitsune, because the flames of her Meltera made quick work of my favorite familiar.The Zeograth was also caught in the flames, but continued towards the snake, distracting both heads of the Meltera who blasted it with their twin flames. From behind, my Wyvern fell upon the vicious snake, and using its razor-edged tail, sliced the beast into two. I had survived the onslaught, I took a moment to breathe, and rushed with my familiars to where Purson and Luzuria fought. Words mostly fail me; epic doesn't suffice: they both moved inhumanely fast, the impact of their blades thundered ",
        "across the valley. The ground shook as their familiars dropped beside them like flies, their screams and roars accented by the sound of thunder and diluvial rains. In the skies, the flames of Azdaha and Drakmar lit the sky with blues and whites, their claws and teeth ripping chunks from their bodies. The Drakmar bit into Azdaha's neck, then drove her into the ground, with an impact that sent a shockwave unlike any I had ever felt. Azdaha raised her neck from the crater, just as Purson's C'Thulhu leaped from the settling dust, and used its crystalline axe to sever her head. Her body dematerialized as would any other familiar. Had she summoned her own Mother? I Luzuria's wrath was unhinged, and Purson parried every blow, but was unable to strike back. He was on the defensive, and quickly losing ground. I sent my Wyvern ",
        "and Zeograth before me to flank her, I had to try something. Purson's Cthulhu was about to swing its axe at Luzuria, but she whipped her tail into Purson's chest, knocking him to the ground, and, free for an instant, she raised her fist to the sky, and brought down a pillar of blinding light upon C'thulhu; nothing but a scorch remained. My Wyvern descended upon her with its tail, but she evaded it with expert precision, cleaving it in half, just in time to to incinerate my Zeograth with her unholy light, and still manage to parry Purson's incoming strike. I tried summoning more familiars, but I had no more strength left in me. I rushed towards her with my dagger in hand, in retrospect, I do not why, for there was nothing I could hope to accomplish. There were no more familiars on the field, how many they summoned I lost count long ago. From the ",
        "skies, her pillars of light came raining down, for each one he dodged, the distance between them lessened. All it took was one brief moment of vulnerability, and Luzuria's sword impaled through Purson's chest. She shrieked with pleasure as his blue blood pooled at his feet. All was (seemed?) doomed. He knew it too, as he looked at me. I had never felt so useless in my life. His eyes sharpened, and his gaze went to my dagger. Of course. I threw my dagger true, right towards Purson, who grabbed it in mid air, and in one quick motion, devoid of hesitation, threw it through her right, purple eye. Her body slumped forward, even in death still grasping Judgment, and as she fell, it cut even deeper into Purson. Around me, no sound could be heard but the rain mixing with the blood of the fallen and the ashes of what once was. Beside him I knelt, ",
        "holding his hand as life seeped away. He was too weak to speak, and yet he tried. \"I know, don't you worry, I know.\" I said as tears poured down my face. I gave him a final kiss, his lips already cold. His eyes gazed into mine, there was no fear, only longing, grief for what could have been. And then it was gone. The reign of Terror of Luzuria Angelicus has ended. Her sample was gathered as was instructed; she will make a powerful addition to the Necronomignon. However, I wonder, by harnessing her powers, are we condoning her actions?",
        "\"Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.\""

        "Grenten, Necromancer from the mermaid colony, relates the story of the conglomerates' invasion in Abbysthrian waters and of the illustrious Venturian's exploit. \n Venturian said he would locate the conglomerate nest himself. For weeks I resisted the idea of him going alone. This refusal overstepped my official duties as head jurist of our colony, I know, but Venturian was my brother. Who would accept the idea of sending their brother to his death? \"Necromancers never work by themselves\", I would say one day; \"this isn't the way of the community\", I would affirm another; \"if we lose you, all hope will be lost\" said I at last, thinking that would deter him. But once Venturian got an idea in his head, nothing could shake it out. He grew focused as a shark. This time, he announced that whether or not ",
        "the council granted him permission, he would go. \"The risk is high,\" said Venturian, \"but we have already lost too many of our own. The beasts have been creeping closer to our homes - my men and I have seen their progress everyday while on our watches. Send me out alone first, then follow my lead if you must. How many months have we held council over this? How much more time will we waste?\" His eyes had not left mine. His powerful hand clasped his trident as though he were holding on for life. And while he spoke, his large chest doubled its size from how he puffed. I had rarely seen his eyes burn with that intensity. He was right, as usual, there was no denying it. I could no longer stand in his way. Venturian enjoyed rare privileges as the finest Speaker in the colony. His singularly far-reaching voice can travel for miles and miles ",
        "underwater. Moreover, he can communicate elaborate messages from incredible distances and they will reach you as though he had spoken directly in your ear. Above all, the frequency of his voice could temporarily stun conglomerates, causing them to move slower than usual, which was unprecedented. For months, Venturian witnessed the rapid growth of the conglomerates. But nothing could have prepared him for what the issue was going to become. In fact, they never used to be violent, but they grew in numbers as they grew in aggressivity. Our people were sought out by the people on land when catpricorns started washing up on shores, bloated with poison, entangled in tentacles. The conglomerate quickly became the nation's enemy. It choked Abbysthrian waters, colonized shoreline and ocean floor, snuffed ",
        "out whatever life it could find. Tens of native species were wiped out in a matter of months. Now our sacred catpricorn was in danger. It is the animal that brought my people into existence. Our histories are intertwined in a sense; our ancestors, who were then mere pilgrim golems[1], first saw the catpricorn and decided its form was ideal for their needs. The particularity of the catpricorn is that it has the torso of a feline mammal and the bottom of a fish. Within a few generations, we settled a colony underwater. It was by then that the extent of the conglomerate problem became clear. A close encounter with a swarm of conglomerates had stunned Venturian beyond recovery. He who was usually calm and undisturbed by anything now obsessed over the beasts. While out patrolling around the castle walls with his division, he witnessed a ",
        "group of returning hunters being tracked by a swarm of conglomerates. \"They seemed to be aware that they were being followed because they made haste. But then the conglomerates did something unthinkable: they assembled into a massive body, in the shape of a fish, and gave powerful thrusts forward, charging at the hunters. The conglomerates then broke apart and went to surround the hunters, trapping them like we trap fish in nets. At that moment, however, a deafening sound shook the ocean depths, something that could only be characterized as a growl from a famished beast. As soon as the sound ended, the conglomerates, as though by command, came undone and all went in the same direction.\" \"That sounds like a fantastic story,\" I replied, unconvinced. \"Who ever heard of conglomerates forming one mass? How about you, Seren, ",
        "\"do you believe that?\" I immediately saw from Seren's incredulous face that he would side with Venturian. \"Y-yes, certainly fantastic; terrifying too,\" he replied at last. \"Conglomerates have never been hospitable towards us, however,\" I said, \"how is this different from any other encounter? Fine, they found a new form to embody, so what?\" Venturian sighed and said, \"I suppose you'll have to see.\" The council and I ended up approving his decision. But it was agreed that a team would be sent out to follow him and ensure his safety. I decided to join too, out of curiosity. All that he needed to do was to locate the nest and return immediately. The following day, hundreds of conglomerates lazily swam past my team when we went out to follow Venturian's trail. We were a small group of a few soldiers. Venturian's voice was our beacon, ",
        "telling us where to go, what to avoid. His voice rose and fell like an ocean swell, each inflection striking and stunning every conglomerate instantly. One by one, we slashed the monsters with our blades, reducing them to a gelatinous pulp. The water soon became clouded with their remains. We were a long way from our colony now and could only go forward. Panic seized us when we ceased to hear Venturian's voice. No matter how loud we called, all that surrounded us was the vast, damp emptiness only the ocean's silence is capable of creating. I called out to the rest, \"Fall to your designated group and stay together. Whatever you do, don't scatter out. You will follow my lead now.\" We hardly had the time to follow through with the formations we'd planned when a swarm of conglomerates rose stealthily from under us, trapping us in a ",
        "sphere. Some soldiers took matters into their own hands and darted away, but were shocked on the spot. There was no escape; the conglomerate set its sights on us with its hundred eyes and wouldn't stop until every single one of us was dead. I severely regretted coming out now. The sphere tightened its ring around us. Then, the sound. We were much closer to it now; everyone, myself included, felt its frequencies ripple through our body. One by one, the conglomerates peeled away from their formation and glided in the same direction as stealthily as they had arrived. The sight was incredible: thousands of conglomerates flocked from all parts of the ocean and poured into a massive fissure in the ocean floor, disappearing out of sight. At that moment, I heard the faintest sound, as though it were coming from very far away: it was ",
        "Venturian. He had reached the bottom of their nest. But I couldn't understand the rest of his message. I got closer to the mouth of the opening and called back. \n \"They have a queen to feed,\" Venturian said, \"and she is hungry.\" \n \n \n \n [1] In the elemental world, pilgrims are golems who have yet to choose their elemental body. They go on a \"pilgrimage\" when they wish to choose what form to embody by traveling across the colonies."

        "Here, on planet Gogira, we encounter a world of giants. Everywhere you look, plants, creatures, land masses are of exaggerated size. The food chain is strictly adhered to, where the dragons sit at the top while everything else sits below them. Once uncontrollably violent, dragons nearly eradicated all living species on the planet. Being the only sentient species on Gogira they gradually realized the deficiencies of their behavior and have since cut back on their slaughter. Instead, they decided to cultivate the planet that they live on and care for the beasts that inhabit it. And while most dragons no longer wage war on every being they encounter, some give way to their primal instincts. It is thanks to the dragons' efforts that we can write about the Zeograth today. For the very first time, we will present a portrait of this enigmatic ",
        "creature that has fascinated explorers for years since Gogira's discovery. A carnivore, the Zeograth is a robust, clever, and dangerous animal, though the latter can be said of most Gogiran creatures. What makes it such a robust animal is its natural protective shell that sits on its back as well as its thick skin that has a high resistance to fire, clawings and chomps administered by even the toughest dragons, to a point. Not entirely a social animal, it hangs out in packs for efficiency's sake: it is easier for them to catch prey that way since they are on the smaller side on a Gogiran scale. But zeograths will even fight among themselves and wage clan wars, especially if there is food involved. Most packs are for life but if many members die, it is not uncommon for another pack to take in the zeograths left. On the other hand, before reaching ",
        "adulthood however, an infant zeograth is extremely vulnerable to the elements and the dangers around. With its protective shell still in development, its chances of survival from an attack are extremely low. For this reason, mother zeograths are strikingly  protective in the first five years of a zeograth's life. The following episode recounts such a phenomenon. What is the relationship between a mother zeograth and its kid?: Deep in the jungle, a mother and her kid walk along a hidden trail: today is bath day and they are on their way to the lake. It is rather rare for zeograths to travel alone like this, but this mother and her kid were recently separated from their pack after a surprise attack of a Green Carpenter - one of the most lethal spiders of its kind. This is why the mother is taking extra precaution. These thoughts probably ",
        "don't cross baby zeograth's mind; it bounces excitedly along its mother, jumping every now and again to playfully nip at her ears. Mother walks on, very much enjoying her little one's playful antics, but she must also keep an eye out for any lurking danger. In this merciless world, all it takes is one moment of distraction to end it all. The lake is teeming with creatures. This is no surprise: it is a hot and sunny day. Mother knew this ahead of time and planned her route leading to a little nook away from the others. Wyverns, carnivorous insects, dragons of all sorts, and other zeograths have also gathered at the lake today. And though everyone is here to enjoy a nice day by the water and basking in the sun, carnage is never too far. The zeograth mother stands close to her little one, acting as a shield to anyone who tries to harm her child. ",
        "Growing tired of its mother's protection, the energetic child plays around, splashing water about, swimming out in the deep end. It's begun to attract attention, and not the good kind. To communicate with each other, zeograths emit a modulated series of cries that closely resemble yelping. She wishes she didn't have to do this and attract more attention, but that is the only way she can communicate to her little one the urgency of coming back by her side. Exasperated by her child's disobedience, she decides to swim to it herself. With a short snap, she grabs its tail between her teeth and drags him back to shore. But they now have company: a hungry earthen dragon. Baby zeograth hides behind its mother while she menacingly growls. But she is at a disadvantage: there is no one else to help her. She also knows the dragon is too burly ",
        "and slow to catch her if she sprints away. Her timing must be impeccable and unpredictable. Before she can make a move however, the dragon swipes at her with its tail - she dodges it expertly. When he does it again, this time she is ready: she sinks her teeth into the tail, crushing its scales and bursting blood vessels. The Zeograth's secret weapon is their ability to lock their jaws onto any limb after which they secrete a venom that incapacitates their enemy. According to scientists, this fast acting venom creates blood clots, thus dramatically reducing blood circulation, often resulting in heart failure. She alone cannot kill this dragon given its size, but it will destabilize it for the time being. The child has now ran away to take shelter behind a boulder by the water. But what is that faint rumble in the distance? It is a pack of ",
        "zeograths arriving at the scene! Without so much of a thought, they throw themselves on the dragon, latching onto any available surface. Finally the mother can let go and must be relieved now that the others have taken over. In no time at all, the dragon stumbles and falls to the ground, its head landing with a splash on the shore. And just like that: lunch is served. Thankfully, mother and baby survived to see another day though the mother is injured and too tired to get up. One of the other zeograths from the pack, noticing the mother lying on the ground with her kid sitting next to her, brings over a chunk of flesh for them to eat. They have officially joined a new pack."

        "In the now dead world of Carcosa, humanity did not know of magick, or practice it. There was nothing mystical or outside of the realms of nature in Carcosa, except of course, for Mother Penance. Mother Penance was a being who would appear once per year, a silent being of holy light, who took and embraced the humans of Carcosa, and freed them from their guilt, lifting the burdens that had tormented them. Every year, huge festivities would arise upon her arrival, and she would wait until all of the pilgrims had come to soothe their pains. She would listen quietly, yet attentively, listening through their pain, their tears, their guilt, their sorrows; their grief. For many humans, Mother Penance's warm embrace was the only place where they practiced honesty, for deceit ran deep in the human ",
        "psyche. Whoever left, left feeling rejuvenated, with a new purpose, ready for what comes next. Both the innocent and the guilty were welcome to her, and she would take their burdens from them. While her presence was a constant over centuries, as Carcosa's extreme desertification began, those who had built high walls around the last city blocked the commoners outside from their communion. She still came, year by year, but her loving and caring expression seemed to have gained a certain edge. This became more pronounced as the years went by, with the numbers of people allowed access to her dwindling with each visit. In the Last Year of Carcosa, Mother Penance came to the city, and opened her arms to welcome the sullen in need. Yet, only the nobles came, and as they cried in her arms, they admitted to ",
        "their sins. The abandonment of the people behind the city walls, left to day of thirst and starvation. Within the city walls, the Nobility demanded tributes, leaving even the privileged city-dwellers with the bare minimum to survive. They made no concessions, they made no reconciliations, they took, they hoarded, they neglected, and they left their people to die, abandoned by the nobility that had sworn to protect them. When confronted with these sins, something different happened; it was as if she had snapped: Mother Penance tore out one of her four wings, and as she did so, it turned into a most grim scythe. Her body of radiant light morphed into a gruesome form: dark, evil, and reeking of decay. Mother Penance had had enough, and she began her unholy retribution in the halls of the Nobles of Carcosa.",
        "With inhuman speed and ferocity, she enacted her punishment upon the royal sinners. Many perished within instants, as she flew into the crowd, slicing with her scythe, painting the ceilings with their blood. The Royal Guards were quick to intervene, and managed to save many of the royals, but they did not fare much better against Mother Penance's horrific powers. It was a slaughter, bodies and the screams of dying men begging for their mothers filled the room, while reinforcements stayed by the doors, afraid to engage with the murderous being in front of them. Surrounded by corpses of the wicked and their conscripted protectors, Mother Penance stood still, taking in the reality of her actions. She approached one of the wounded soldiers, who screamed and shook as he held the stump of the hand she ",
        "had mercilessly severed. She approached the wounded soldier, who tried to crawl away while pleading for help. She grabbed him from the ground, and touched his wound: the bleeding stopped, and the wound healed, forming a layer of skin. He would not bleed to death. The Royal Guard scrambled to his comrades, who were still paralyzed with fear, for their swords and spears were no match for the vicious Deity in front of them. Mother Penance cast her scythe down, although it floated, and lowered her head. The Scythe, by itself, swung upwards, decapitating her hooded head, and her form dissolved into nothingness, leaving only the scythe, and the carnage around it as the only evidence of her visit. When Humanity migrated to Abbysthria, the Scythe was brought. Now that we understand Necromancy, I will be using a ",
        "sample from it, and add it to the ink I am writing with. We have never attempted summoning a Deity such as her; I can only hope that the Necromancers are right, that familiars are nothing but an empty husk. Because if they are not, I fear for what might be unleashed. Progress has its risks I suppose."

        "I felt imperceptibly small the first time I set foot in the dragon world. It was my first time leaving my colony, given the task of cataloguing the history of dragons. The sheer size of everything in this world was starting to overwhelm me, but the dragon guiding me gave me an understanding smile and tried to take my mind off it. \"So you're interested in our history, hm? I'm sure you're aware it's a grim one,\" she said. I nodded. It was no secret how violent the dragons had been in the past, or how they had almost destroyed themselves, but there was still much to learn about them. \"How about I tell you Terraos' tale then,\" she mused, partly to herself, as she led me through the large lands. \"Terraos was our saviour during war times. She stood strong against the cannibal dragons attempting to destroy us and drove them away.\" The dragon's eyes shined with pride as she spoke about her hero. I took out my notebook as she began to tell me the tale. It went as follows: ",
        "The lesser dragons scrambled to flee the cannibalistic ones in pursuit of them. The cannibal ones, no doubt being stronger, easily managed to snatch and drag the lesser ones back from the shore as they tried to reach the sea. They were outmatched and their numbers were dwindling. It was starting to seem futile, until they heard a large rumble and felt a giant impact behind them. Terraos stood between the lesser dragons and the cannibals. She bared her teeth and let out a threatening growl. The cannibals scoffed at Terraos, what could one measly dragon do? But Terraos was fierce, not letting a single dragon get past. She barrelled into them as they swarmed her, tossing them aside and creating tremors in the earth with her movements. Like a golem, she didn't budge under their barrage of attacks. They clawed and bit at her but she swung her massive arms and caused the cannibals to collide with one another. Bit by bit, she was fighting them off. ",
        "The cannibals were getting angry. Terraos shook the ground when they were far and attacked them without mercy when they were close. It felt like there was no end to this battle. While it may have seemed that way, Terraos knew she was reaching her limit. Her limbs were starting to feel heavy and her breaths were ragged. Even so, she continued to fight viciously without pause. She spread her wings and flew towards the sky, sending gales through the air as she did. She charged at the cannibals, knocking down the ones in the air as hard as she could. She attacked them one after the other, savagely tearing at them all until they couldn't fight back anymore. With this wild dragon in front of them, the cannibals almost completely forgot about the lessser dragons escaping, completely focused on Terraos. It didn't take long for them to realize she was losing steam though. They could see now her increasingly wild attacks were out of desperation, and they far outnumbered her. It was ",
        "only a matter of time before they would bring her down. Still, Terraos managed to avoid the inevitable for quite a while. She went on the defensive, landing on the ground once again and parrying the attacking dragons' strikes rather than striking herself. Nearly all the lesser dragons had reached the sea by now and were making their escape. With this knowledge, Terraos let herself relent for just a little, but that was all the attacking dragons needed to get a hit on her. One managed to break through her defence and tore a deep gash from her neck down the side of her torso. Terraos stumbled and fell, the earth rumbling along as she did. She had no more strength to get up. Terraos knew time was up for her, so she decided, as a last-ditch effort, to take everyone down with her. Another dragon drove their claws into her front, and Terraos howled. Massive shockwaves erupted from where she lay, destroying anything that got too close. The cannibal dragons were nearly wiped out ",
        "completely from the impact, and only a few remained to see the aftermath, as well as see the last of the lesser dragons make it to the sea. When the dust had settled, mountains and ridges lay in the ground where they had not before, jagged and pointed towards the attacking dragons. Not much remained of Terraos as her power had seeped through the earth, but she had done her duty. She had won. \n I listened, completely enraptured as the dragon recounted Terraos' heroics. She stopped walking once we reached a large altar in the center of the city. On it lay a pile of what looked to be bones. \"These are Terraos' remains,\" said the dragon. I studied them carefully before taking out a small scraper. \"May I?\" I asked. The dragon looked a little confused but nodded. I scraped a small amount off the remains and added it to my summoning ink. ",
        "I wrote in my Necronomignon and summoned Terraos. The dragon I was with was rather shocked, but the shock changed into awe after a moment, completely astonished to see her hero in the flesh. More dragons started to gather around us when they heard the commotion, and all of them immediately recognized their old protector instantly. There were hushed whispers in the crowd as they weren't sure how to react. After a while, they began to cheer. Terraos, of course, didn't show any response as she was just a familiar now, but the dragons were moved all the same."

Pandemonium ensued. The Brethren of Frostsong, a growing deathcult of apocalyptical zealots, felt justified in their scriptures prophecy, and began their final chapter, The Holy Struggle. Millions were slaughtered by bloodthirsty psychopaths, following the words of a long-dead tyrant who promised his followers the world, once it had been cleansed of sinners by the Frostsong. I refused to allow them even a Pyrrhic victory, and thus, I would have to break all dogmas of this world, and have my seance with Om. Those few who could still perform cosmic magick were the most valued targets so I hid, I hid while millions died; I did the covenant with the Veil, the largest sin Velmili. I disrobed and spoke the spell, unholy words that were punishable by death in the times where our world was not on the brink of collapse:",
        "\"Hear me now, Cosmos, above \n For a mortal yearns to see, \n The hidden truths, beyond my scope, \n Cosmos: speak to me. \n \n My mind was plunged into darkness. Then I witnessed the birth of stars, billions of years flowing past in mere minutes. I saw the end of the universe, and then I met Om: an infinitely sprawling net of celestial light. It's net, or grid, contained shining orbs at every intersection of the light beams, reflecting the infinity of every other orb. \n \n \"Hello reflection. It has been long since I have been visited, by your standards, that is. What do you ask of Om?\"",

Powers untold flowed through me. I was now the Cosmic Litch, and I could hear Om speaking to me, a soothing voice from within: \n \"Do you accept the burdens I have bestowed upon you, dear reflection?\" \n \"Yes, I do.

I manifested the Temple of Remembrance: fusing the various elements in the air, snow and rock, until the Cosmic Temple had been formed in its entirety. Not just an impenetrable exterior, but the infrastructure to maintain our homeostasis. With the temple completed, I went to the lowest chamber, and conjured the Simusacrum, a gyrating orb of light that would be the resting place of my sullen people. Everything had been completed, so I raised a pillar of light from the Temple of Remembrance, a beacon of hope for my dying people. Soon, they came, in huddled caravans. Many died on the way, for the frost had been getting worse by each passing day. Those who came to be saved in the Simusacrum could touch the orb, and their conscious mind transported within it. ",
        "Their former flesh vessels, dissolved to and reforged into Biosteel, which would be used to create the Clockwork Automatons, future bodies for those who wish to return to this physical realm. I made them bodies that could be rebuilt, recycled, that and could survive even the frost death of our world. I doubt that anyone will ever enter one, because I have given them the Simusacrum, and it was my duty to protect it. The caravans slowed, and the numbers of arrivals were dwindling. Survivors of the Brethren of Frostsong's carnage told me of countless joining their ranks, in desperate attempts to avoid their doom. They had no mercy, and those who were not Bretheren, had to be destroyed, for if not, the world will never be reborn for them. I sealed the temple, and prepared for my last stand against the Zealots, just myself and the two Mandoro Guardians. Despite the Frost having thinned their horde, there numbers were immense, a final stand against any heretics.",
        "I killed countless to defend the temple, and I hope I did the right thing. The frost will take the rest soon enough, for they retreated into the growing blizzards. I am dying now, the threat is stopped, but the Temple of Remembrance has not been breached, and the Simusacrum will protect my people. These are my last thoughts entrusted to the Clockwork Queen, the eternal custodian of my people. I am in pain, their scythes having shredded my form. I'm not afraid. I made a choice, and did what I set out to accomplish. I just hope that I can be forgiven for what I had to...\" His life ended in that moment, his corpse preserved in honor by myself. I will sleep now. Perhaps one day new life will find us. And they will know that once there were the Velmili, and on the eve of their doom, the Cosmic Litch gave himself to save our memory from oblivion. It is the year 2177 of Velmili Standard Time. Goodnight dear reflections."
