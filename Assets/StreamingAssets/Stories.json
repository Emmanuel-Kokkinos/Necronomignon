        "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.",
        "Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men. A time will come—but I must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript, my executors may put caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye."

      "pages": [
        "The kitsunes were burning villages again. Reports stated that due to a severe decrease in the population of rodents, the kitsunes' natural prey, the beasts took to eating fowls instead, burning villages along the way. \"I've been receiving a significant amount of pressure to eliminate the kitsunes,\" our president Lydia Wollstonecraft confessed. \"I understand those views; the damage they have caused on Neo-Carcosan territory is nearly irreversible; they've destroyed very valuable farmland.\" She paused and gazed out the window overlooking the city of Mirrulak, all glittering and vibrant like seawater under a brilliant sun. \"That being said,\" she continued, \"the conditions we escaped from desolate Carcosa by coming here are still vivid in memory, like a fresh wound. If this isn't too hard a request to ask of you, drive the beasts away from the ",
        "villages instead of slaughtering them as the Neo-Carcosan government wants. You could perhaps lead them towards the north-eastern mountains. Let's try to kill as few Abbysthrian animals as possible, please.\" She addressed herself chiefly to Adeline Partishred and I, Felix Lockhart, as we are the head of Abbysthrian conservation, biological and paranormal studies. But in the corner of the room stood a young, well-dressed man. His face was handsome and smart; he wore silky clothes with purple hues that danced when he moved. Andrew Huxley Paine was his name. \"Paine is the Mirrulakan representative of the Neo-Carcosan government. He will accompany you to ensure that the situation is taken care of. He knows everything there is to know about kitsunes, so he'll be of great help.\" And on that, we made haste for preparations and left the very next day. ",
        "From the capital, it was a five day trek to the village. Gradually, the scenes unfolded from healthy fields to wetlands, to dry plains. On the last day, Neo-Carcosa's snow caps broke the monotony of the horizon. Under them sprawled miles and miles of charred land. Though we hadn't encountered a single one of the beasts on our way, their presence was felt all around. Despair and decay greeted us: crooked skeletons of houses spread flakes of ash off what was left of their shingled roofs; once luxuriant fields now exposed their furrows that protruded out of the earth like ribs. The region itself seemed to groan from hunger. And an unaccountable, pungent smell assaulted my nostrils. It was unmistakable: Neo-Carcosa was virtually unrecognizable in a matter of months. The village we stayed in was one of the fortunate few that had been spared from ",
        "the kitsunes' fatal visits. When we arrived at last, we were greeted by one of the shepherds who had first reported the sighting. He was also to be our host. His home was humble, but there was enough room for three weary travelers. \"We'll need to lure them away from the villages that are still standing. If it's fowls they're after, we'll get a few and use them as bait,\" Paine proposed after supper. He then got out a map of the region and pointed out different routes we could take the kitsunes down from aboard the phoenix. Our aim was to drive them to the mountains as Wollstonecraft proposed, but ultimately, context would determine outcome. \"How we'll preserve the bait is the question\", I advanced practically. \"Is there any salt here?\" Adeline asked our host. He nodded, looking perplexed. \"To cure the meat! You're a genius, ",
        "Ada!\" I exclaimed. We had settled on the plan; but sleep that night didn't come easily for any of us. The very next morning, we set out to find old or sick fowls that would make good bait. Few farmers consented to abandoning their own for a general lack of food, but in such cases, monetary compensation wasn't uncommon. A day or two before sighting the pack, a smog had begun to gather and thicken over the plains like a veil; rancid fumes assaulted our nostrils; the earth had become a carcass left to rot in the sun. When we returned from our daily rounds of gathering fowls that had been particularly tortuous from the demonic odor, I asked our host where it came from. He cast a resentful glance towards the city's looming factory towers, shrugged, and turned away. By our sixth day, we'd gathered enough bait for a pack of hungry kitsunes. Providence ",
        "had it that our host saw paw prints while out foraging herbs in the thicket. To assure us that they were a kitsune's prints, he pointed out that they seemed to sear the earth. We wasted no time. After summoning the phoenix, we gathered the bait into a net that we tied shut with a long rope that we then fastened onto the phoenix's feet. Then off we flew. We needn't look any farther than the closest body of water. The pack rested by the lake north of the village. The stench from the factories didn't reach this area much, leading me to believe that this was their resting place. About seven of them travelled together, mostly smaller kitsunes with no more than three of four tails; their leader, on the other hand, sported nine. According to local folklore, the more tails a kitsune has, the more powerful it is. We needed to proceed with caution. ",
        "But Paine then said: \"Let's get closer to them and drop the bag so they can get a whiff of the goods!\" We circled down until we were a few meters above the pack before dropping the bait. However, the net had been dropped too low; in no time, some of the kitsunes had already snatched it while the others roasted the rope until it snapped. That's when the leader of the pack interfered. Out of nowhere, it rose in a column of fire and blew a fireball on the phoenix's face causing us to crash in the forest. We were all thrown to the ground immediately. Luckily, none of us were injured. Our phoenix soon disintegrated and disappeared. We were soon surrounded by snarling kitsunes. Slowly, they closed in on us. I could see the vermillion mark on their forehead with clarity. It seemed to dance on their wavering fur with a flame-like quality. ",
        "Lydia's request that we save the kitsunes was well out of the question now. With a trembling hand, I summoned the phoenix once more; it rushed to the sky vigorously, like it had never been slain, and came plunging down, straight as an arrow. Meters before colliding with the ground, the phoenix suddenly spread its wings and braked. I called Adeline and Paine to take cover so we wouldn't be flattened by the blow. The powerful gust sent three of the smaller kitsunes violently tumbling into trees, yet the leader stood stoically, unaffected. Instead, it once more cast a column of fire in the gust and leaped through the blow in the attempt to sink its fangs into my phoenix's flesh. However, the phoenix's body turned into a lake of fire and it scorched the alpha kitsune's mouth instantly, burning through its face like it was made of paper. ",
        "The other kitsunes conjured columns of their own and riddled the phoenix's face and underbelly with fireballs. The bird retorted by fully spreading its wings and sending fireballs raining on the kitsunes before whirling and shoving them to the ground with powerful bats of the wing. Soon, it was all over. At last, the night had regained its characteristic silence. The forest hardly stirred save for the wind whistling through the pines overhead. I called the phoenix back into the Book. With some hesitation, I walked over to the body of the alpha kitsune. Its white fur was blackened and curled from fireballs. Patches of it had been burned right off, revealing a layer of glossy flesh that had melted and merged with some fur. It panted shortly and tensely - it did not have long to live. Paine came by my side and looked down at the fallen beast. ",
        "\"Leaving it here like this will do it no good.\" He unsheathed his sword and, with a trembling grip, let his blade fall upon the kitsune's neck. Its breath was sucked out and a pool of blood soon formed at our feet. A moment of dumb stupor passed before I came to my senses and stooped to collect a sample of the blood in a small bottle. With it, we can summon the alpha kitsune in the future. The future. I do wonder what that means for us and this place. We never managed to relocate the kitsunes, only succeeded in slaughtering them. We've already altered the state of things. Something tells me this book will eventually lead us to see through a glass darkly."

        "She passed away peacefully. Her extremities were spotted brown and rotted right off her body; healing potions could no longer prevent it from spreading. A few days after my return, she was unrecognizable, more corpse than living. When I had first heard of Mau'kra's illness, the school year was reaching its end. Every day for a month, I had finals to hand out and battles to evaluate. An old friend of mine, one of the few I had left in the colony, delivered her message. Mau'kra, my beloved, my dearest friend, had less than a few weeks to live and asked that I came to hear her last wishes. Usually, the final days at school are the most exciting; a feverish kind of energy stirs the air. This year however, the final days dripped away too slowly. No amount of praying, swearing or sighing could bring me by her side any faster. But to Mau'kra, time  ",
        "was slipping by too fast; I nearly missed her. The day of my arrival, she was down to her last leaves. When I held her hand, it felt like holding twigs. \"Your position in Mirrulak will not interfere with the way we do things here.\" Such were the elders' words. \"She will be inhumed as we've always done it.\" \"But these are her wishes, not my own. I know the code and have never disrespected it.\" I replied. Mau'kra and I were once more up against the elders' inflexibility. Ever since coming back, eyes follow me wherever I go; ears weigh and evaluate my every word. Conversations are hushed when I arrive among groups, but their silent gazes only confirm what I have known for a long time. \"You have been gone for too long,\" another friend told me, self-evidently, \"Trust is more easily gained when one is among their own.\" \"What's the point in fighting to earn ",
        "the trust of those who despise you? They simply want to have their own way, as usual, because Mau'kra's wishes go against their so-called 'values'.\" \"That is why they are weary of you; you have grown entitled since you left for Mirrulak.\" The words stung, but pride fastened my lips shut. Nothing had changed since I left. If anything, the jungle had expanded to accommodate the growing community. Still, the architecture was very much the same: houses were fashioned inside hollow trees; their canopies formed a lofty roof keeping the outside out and what lied below in. The earthen domain burst out of the arid ground of the desert into a luscious jungle east of the aquatic domain further west; the Nunu river connected the two. From above, our domain seemed like a green eye shedding perpetual tears into the sea. For days after ",
        "Mau'kra's funeral, debates led by our elders and other prominent community members were held. I, of course, was refused entrance to both the meetings and the burial site. First I fought it, then it became clear that the more I fought, the less chances I had to carry out Mau'kra's wishes. Thankfully, some old friends, those who still had an ounce of courage left in them, fought on my behalf. They were comparatively few in the face of those who went against Mau'kra's last will, however. I took to ambling around to take my mind off things. I returned to my old home that was now occupied by a family of dwarves. Inside, they had stacked rocks and gems around the walls causing the interior to seem darker than it was. None of my plants and carvings were there anymore. The only remaining sign of my passage there was the portrait of Mau'kra and ",
        "I in one of the tree knots that I'd carved. Our features have since been smoothed and worn by time and now seemed to melt into one another. Exile, the word had never felt more tangible. Her dwelling was just beside mine. Every new year, we would watch the world fade to darkness during the eclipse from her tree's canopy. Then we would join the others for celebrations. Now, her home is marked untouchable, as all other deceased homes are. They become sacred grounds for new life to form. Her essence would already have merged with the rest- I wondered if it was even too late to collect it; I also wondered if this was the way our elders bought time. \"I know that I can trust you, Neerma\" she told me the day before her passing. \"It will be difficult, but do not lose faith. You will prevail.\" Mau'kra's shrunken eyes shone with the same defiance as ",
        "years past. Her voice had grown weak, reduced to a half whisper, but that did nothing to overshadow her strength. \"Do you realize what you ask of me? I'm already branded an outsider, they will never listen.\" \"Have faith,\" was all she said. Reclining on her bed of dry leaves and withering flowers, Mau'kra's dark shape stood in stark contrast to the glossy green leaves that supported her decaying body. However, when I looked at her, I saw not the decay, but her old radiant self; the crisp, fresh flowers adorning her crown and encircling her waist; the perfume following wherever she went; the rich vibrato carrying her voice when she sang by the river. She was the only one who encouraged me to leave our domain and join the Elemental School Board when it first opened. She stood up to the conservatism of our elders who confused ",
        "unconditional care with overwrought control. The day of her passing, she told me a different story. \"After you left, I prayed you would come back. I even prayed something terrible would happen, like the elders had told us, so you would be driven back here. But it was out of weakness that I did so. Deep down, I wished I had had your courage to leave. So I offer you my body as a gift.\" As I wandered, I felt the world press in. Despite the physical expanse, the high rising trees, the great rushing river, everything seemed to have eyes, dissecting my every move. Everything seemed to be telling me to leave, to give up. But for her sake, I wouldn't. A verdict was finally reached. After a week of debates, the elders finally gave in. I was allowed to collect what remained of her and inscribe her into the Necronomignon. That was if there were any remains to ",
        "collect. When I entered her abode, she had already disintegrated to merge with the foliage and new grown life. I took as many samples as I could - the chances of this being a success were now next to none, but by some miracle, it happened. In the late hours by the river, I summoned her. She floated before me with the body I'd always known. This time she had no voice and the flowers on her head and waist had no perfume. Her eyes had lost their lustre; but from now on, she would never leave my side."

        "The following entry is written by Jamie Hopswitch, Necromancer and editor of Miskatonic Academy's Tribune. Hopswitch was sent to the dragon's colony on Abbysthria and charged with understanding the relationship between dragons and wyverns. Editor's notes will always be in brackets: \n [Today, Irvina allowed me to collect a sample of a wyvern that had already died. Usually she's a little put off by my being a Necromancer and all, but she also understands that I cannot return to Mirrulak empty handed. We spent the day in her backyard (it is the size of an entire village) talking and observing her wyverns, for whom she has unabashed enthusiasm it was at times irritating. Below is an approximate transcript of my time with Irvina and her wyverns. For continuity and coherence, I deem it necessary to continue interjecting every now and again.] ",
        "\"JAMIE, PROMISE ME THAT BEFORE YOU LEAVE, YOU'LL COME HUNTING WITH ME AT LEAST ONCE?? YOU'VE GOT TO SEE WYVERNS HUNT, THEY'RE AMAZING!!!  [Alright so here is a sample of my reproduction of Irvina's speech. I will now proceed to write in the usual typography for the reader's benefit - and mine. By the way, I did take her up on that offer, but that will be for another entry. I've got enough to report already.] \"You know, wyverns and dragons have coexisted for ages. Legend has it that wyverns were once the best predators in this world, even outdoing us dragons. Of course, that's only because we were still lizards, not dragons yet. You better believe that once we had evolved into our present form, we overpowered them. [As per natural dragon law, you are literally what you eat. Any Gogiran animal absorbs the ",
        "properties of the things they eat. So eating the rivaling sentient species on their planet, these very intelligent and special animals that, according to Irvina, resembled humans (a rather disturbing thought if you ask me) helped develop dragons' cognitive skills. Basically, dragons forced their own evolution which is pretty rad to be honest.] Like I told you the other day, wyverns make great hunting companions. Remember seeing that frolick flying above with a dragon the other day? They were going to hunt. Wyverns, you see, are more agile in flight and can have far better eyesight! That's from that insect diet of theirs. \"But how did wyverns and dragons come to be such iconic partners you ask? [I hadn't.] Excellent question! Hundreds of years ago, before I had hatched, before my mother had even thought of hatching her first egg, there ",
        "was a terrible epidemic. Dragons all across Gogira were being attacked by these terrible pests that climbed under our scales and fed off our... blood! Isn't that disgusting??? I still have shivers when I think about it. [So did I.] No one knew where these pests came from so no one had a ready solution. None of the traditional medicines helped. The way my grandma told it, there were dragon bodies laying all over the place with insects swollen to a bust with their blood, feeding off them. Some of the bodies were soooo consumed by the pests, we could hardly make out their original shape. EWWW right?? And the risk of contamination was so high, entire villages were deserted if there was even a single case. This was destabilizing for dragons because they are usually very sedentary and thrive in communities. All of a sudden, they had to ",
        "uproot and search for a new place to call home. Those who were sick weren't so lucky though. It wasn't long before the elders called for mass quarantining stations across the continent. All the contaminated dragons had to either bring themselves there or stay put where they were to avoid contaminating others. A week went by like this. Some of the strongest dragons fell and everyone was starting to feel very insecure about this - How much longer would this go on for? Now for this bit, I need you to use your mind's eye. Imagine seeing the shadow of thousands of flying wyverns circling the sky. They arrived out of nowhere and in such great numbers! The sky almost seemed too small to contain them all. It was as though they had all convened to meet at that very hour on that very day. And then, the unthinkable happened: in one coordinated ",
        "swoop, they all flew down to the dragons in the quarantine station where my grandma was being treated. She thought that they were going to devour her even if they aren't even carnivores! Like, what if that changed? The world was then shut out once a frolic of five wyverns flapped around her and picked at the swollen pests that had grown to the size of two of her eyes. [For measurement, a dragon's eye is roughly the size of my fists put together. Absolutely gross.] Unlike what she thought would happen, the wyverns feasting over her didn't hurt at all. On the contrary, relief flowed through her like a tidal wave she said! And how the wyverns relished in it! Once they'd eaten everything off, she felt better within days. And from that day onward, the wyverns stayed by her side and every dragon's side too. [At that moment, Irvina reached ",
        "under one of her scales and pulled out an insect as large as my fist and called one of her wyverns over. The creature hopped over, its ears pulled back, its big eyes sparkling with the brilliance of a hundred stars, and stopped in front of us. It took absolutely no interest in me, much to my disappointment, but that's not the point. Once it stopped in front of us, it leaned back on its hind legs and spread its large wings, as though ready for take-off. Irvina tossed the bug in the air and no sooner did the beast leap with a great gust and catch it. Back on the ground, the wyvern returned to its spot and, in poised, attentive stillness, suckled on the bug as though all of its attention were devoted to extracting the maximum amount of taste from its treat. It, indeed, seemed paralyzed with pleasure.] [Irvina turned to me beaming.] \"Have you ever seen ",
        "anything as adorable? And to think that these same babies can also help me hunt the biggest, fastest prey in all of Gogira! You know, I can say that I prefer their company over many dragons around here: you can take my word for it!\""

Purson said, as he stared upon the smoldering remains, I had never seen his spirits broken such as this. 'How many have been lost to our failures?' he added as a guilty afterthought.

The survivors fled towards us, but she did not move, the ground shook, something was approaching us. 'Astaroth my pupil, no matter what happens, defend the villagers, and if I fall, retreat and tell the others. Luzuria must be stopped at all costs.'

Small for a dragon, yet colossal for anything else, her wings were fair and feathered, her scales an ivory white that gleamed amidst the blazes, and in her face, one could read only malevolence. She was the first dragon to walk on two legs, the first to have hands, the first Necromancer of Dragonkind. At her feet, impaled deep into the ground, was the greatsword Judgment, the fabled Dwarmaskus Steel blade of the late Sunthor Earthbound, one of the many fallen in the attempts to end her rampage. In a swift, sudden movement, she ripped Judgment from the ground with one hand, a feat of strength meant to demoralize us, for even famed Sunthor used both of his. I was afraid, and I glanced at Purson for reassurance, but even he seemed troubled by the sight. ",
        "She grinned, and her voice thundered:\t' AHHHHH, PURSON, I DIDN'T EXPECT TO MEET YOU SO SOON. HAS THE DESPERATION TAKEN HOLD OF?' ' Luzuria Angelicus, you have transgressed every imaginable rule that binds the worlds together. Your reign of terror ends here, I recommend you surrender right now.' Purson said, as he drew his blade. \"NOTED...\" In a blink of an eye, her familiars materialized before her, their hollow eyes ablaze with the same evil that burned in hers, and Azdaha took to the air. \"...BUT THEN HOW WILL I ADD YOU TO MY COLLECTION?\" With demonic speed, and angelic grace, she pushed herself off the ground and soared, blade aimed true, right towards Purson. Before he evaded her, his own familiars appeared, already charging towards our foes. Amidst the ",
        "cacophony of slaughter, the clash of their swords rang louder. Her attacks were relentless, yet Purson stood his ground. Around them, familiars savagely slayed each other , but for each one slain, in an instant, another would be spawned, a true display of mastery.Wyvern, Kitsune, Zeograth and Dryad I summoned to aid the fight, but amidst the clash of steel, one glance from Luzuria was all it took before three more creatures materialized: Manticore, Gargoyle and Meltera, ready to intercept my own. Her Manticore lept into my Dryad, ripping it in half immediately with its cavernous maw, but my wyvern swooped in, grabbing it with its claws, ascending back into the sky, and dropping it into the snapping mouth of my Zeograth; it disintegrated into nothingness. Before the Zeograth's mouth was fully closed,her Gargoyle came rushing ",
        "down from above, its blades extended and aimed for the eyes. I sent my Kitsune up the Zeograth's tail, and it leapt off its head, breathing its fire in midair, incinerating the Gargoyle, who dissipated before even reaching the ground. The same can be said for my Kitsune, because the flames of her Meltera made quick work of my favorite familiar.The Zeograth was also caught in the flames, but continued towards the snake, distracting both heads of the Meltera who blasted it with their twin flames. From behind, my Wyvern fell upon the vicious snake, and using its razor-edged tail, sliced the beast into two. I had survived the onslaught, I took a moment to breathe, and rushed with my familiars to where Purson and Luzuria fought. Words mostly fail me; epic doesn't suffice: they both moved inhumanely fast, the impact of their blades thundered ",
        "across the valley. The ground shook as their familiars dropped beside them like flies, their screams and roars accented by the sound of thunder and diluvial rains. In the skies, the flames of Azdaha and Drakmar lit the sky with blues and whites, their claws and teeth ripping chunks from their bodies. The Drakmar bit into Azdaha's neck, then drove her into the ground, with an impact that sent a shockwave unlike any I had ever felt. Azdaha raised her neck from the crater, just as Purson's C'Thulhu leaped from the settling dust, and used its crystalline axe to sever her head. Her body dematerialized as would any other familiar. Had she summoned her own Mother? I Luzuria's wrath was unhinged, and Purson parried every blow, but was unable to strike back. He was on the defensive, and quickly losing ground. I sent my Wyvern ",
        "and Zeograth before me to flank her, I had to try something. Purson's Cthulhu was about to swing its axe at Luzuria, but she whipped her tail into Purson's chest, knocking him to the ground, and, free for an instant, she raised her fist to the sky, and brought down a pillar of blinding light upon C'thulhu; nothing but a scorch remained. My Wyvern descended upon her with its tail, but she evaded it with expert precision, cleaving it in half, just in time to to incinerate my Zeograth with her unholy light, and still manage to parry Purson's incoming strike. I tried summoning more familiars, but I had no more strength left in me. I rushed towards her with my dagger in hand, in retrospect, I do not why, for there was nothing I could hope to accomplish. There were no more familiars on the field, how many they summoned I lost count long ago. From the ",
        "skies, her pillars of light came raining down, for each one he dodged, the distance between them lessened. All it took was one brief moment of vulnerability, and Luzuria's sword impaled through Purson's chest. She shrieked with pleasure as his blue blood pooled at his feet. All was (seemed?) doomed. He knew it too, as he looked at me. I had never felt so useless in my life. His eyes sharpened, and his gaze went to my dagger. Of course. I threw my dagger true, right towards Purson, who grabbed it in mid air, and in one quick motion, devoid of hesitation, threw it through her right, purple eye. Her body slumped forward, even in death still grasping Judgment, and as she fell, it cut even deeper into Purson. Around me, no sound could be heard but the rain mixing with the blood of the fallen and the ashes of what once was. Beside him I knelt, ",
        "holding his hand as life seeped away. He was too weak to speak, and yet he tried. \"I know, don't you worry, I know.\" I said as tears poured down my face. I gave him a final kiss, his lips already cold. His eyes gazed into mine, there was no fear, only longing, grief for what could have been. And then it was gone. The reign of Terror of Luzuria Angelicus has ended. Her sample was gathered as was instructed; she will make a powerful addition to the Necronomignon. However, I wonder, by harnessing her powers, are we condoning her actions?",
        "\"Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.\""

        "Grenten, Necromancer from the mermaid colony, relates the story of the conglomerates' invasion in Abbysthrian waters and of the illustrious Venturian's exploit. \n Venturian said he would locate the conglomerate nest himself. For weeks I resisted the idea of him going alone. This refusal overstepped my official duties as head jurist of our colony, I know, but Venturian was my brother. Who would accept the idea of sending their brother to his death? \"Necromancers never work by themselves\", I would say one day; \"this isn't the way of the community\", I would affirm another; \"if we lose you, all hope will be lost\" said I at last, thinking that would deter him. But once Venturian got an idea in his head, nothing could shake it out. He grew focused as a shark. This time, he announced that whether or not ",
        "the council granted him permission, he would go. \"The risk is high,\" said Venturian, \"but we have already lost too many of our own. The beasts have been creeping closer to our homes - my men and I have seen their progress everyday while on our watches. Send me out alone first, then follow my lead if you must. How many months have we held council over this? How much more time will we waste?\" His eyes had not left mine. His powerful hand clasped his trident as though he were holding on for life. And while he spoke, his large chest doubled its size from how he puffed. I had rarely seen his eyes burn with that intensity. He was right, as usual, there was no denying it. I could no longer stand in his way. Venturian enjoyed rare privileges as the finest Speaker in the colony. His singularly far-reaching voice can travel for miles and miles ",
        "underwater. Moreover, he can communicate elaborate messages from incredible distances and they will reach you as though he had spoken directly in your ear. Above all, the frequency of his voice could temporarily stun conglomerates, causing them to move slower than usual, which was unprecedented. For months, Venturian witnessed the rapid growth of the conglomerates. But nothing could have prepared him for what the issue was going to become. In fact, they never used to be violent, but they grew in numbers as they grew in aggressivity. Our people were sought out by the people on land when catpricorns started washing up on shores, bloated with poison, entangled in tentacles. The conglomerate quickly became the nation's enemy. It choked Abbysthrian waters, colonized shoreline and ocean floor, snuffed ",
        "out whatever life it could find. Tens of native species were wiped out in a matter of months. Now our sacred catpricorn was in danger. It is the animal that brought my people into existence. Our histories are intertwined in a sense; our ancestors, who were then mere pilgrim golems[1], first saw the catpricorn and decided its form was ideal for their needs. The particularity of the catpricorn is that it has the torso of a feline mammal and the bottom of a fish. Within a few generations, we settled a colony underwater. It was by then that the extent of the conglomerate problem became clear. A close encounter with a swarm of conglomerates had stunned Venturian beyond recovery. He who was usually calm and undisturbed by anything now obsessed over the beasts. While out patrolling around the castle walls with his division, he witnessed a ",
        "group of returning hunters being tracked by a swarm of conglomerates. \"They seemed to be aware that they were being followed because they made haste. But then the conglomerates did something unthinkable: they assembled into a massive body, in the shape of a fish, and gave powerful thrusts forward, charging at the hunters. The conglomerates then broke apart and went to surround the hunters, trapping them like we trap fish in nets. At that moment, however, a deafening sound shook the ocean depths, something that could only be characterized as a growl from a famished beast. As soon as the sound ended, the conglomerates, as though by command, came undone and all went in the same direction.\" \"That sounds like a fantastic story,\" I replied, unconvinced. \"Who ever heard of conglomerates forming one mass? How about you, Seren, ",
        "\"do you believe that?\" I immediately saw from Seren's incredulous face that he would side with Venturian. \"Y-yes, certainly fantastic; terrifying too,\" he replied at last. \"Conglomerates have never been hospitable towards us, however,\" I said, \"how is this different from any other encounter? Fine, they found a new form to embody, so what?\" Venturian sighed and said, \"I suppose you'll have to see.\" The council and I ended up approving his decision. But it was agreed that a team would be sent out to follow him and ensure his safety. I decided to join too, out of curiosity. All that he needed to do was to locate the nest and return immediately. The following day, hundreds of conglomerates lazily swam past my team when we went out to follow Venturian's trail. We were a small group of a few soldiers. Venturian's voice was our beacon, ",
        "telling us where to go, what to avoid. His voice rose and fell like an ocean swell, each inflection striking and stunning every conglomerate instantly. One by one, we slashed the monsters with our blades, reducing them to a gelatinous pulp. The water soon became clouded with their remains. We were a long way from our colony now and could only go forward. Panic seized us when we ceased to hear Venturian's voice. No matter how loud we called, all that surrounded us was the vast, damp emptiness only the ocean's silence is capable of creating. I called out to the rest, \"Fall to your designated group and stay together. Whatever you do, don't scatter out. You will follow my lead now.\" We hardly had the time to follow through with the formations we'd planned when a swarm of conglomerates rose stealthily from under us, trapping us in a ",
        "sphere. Some soldiers took matters into their own hands and darted away, but were shocked on the spot. There was no escape; the conglomerate set its sights on us with its hundred eyes and wouldn't stop until every single one of us was dead. I severely regretted coming out now. The sphere tightened its ring around us. Then, the sound. We were much closer to it now; everyone, myself included, felt its frequencies ripple through our body. One by one, the conglomerates peeled away from their formation and glided in the same direction as stealthily as they had arrived. The sight was incredible: thousands of conglomerates flocked from all parts of the ocean and poured into a massive fissure in the ocean floor, disappearing out of sight. At that moment, I heard the faintest sound, as though it were coming from very far away: it was ",
        "Venturian. He had reached the bottom of their nest. But I couldn't understand the rest of his message. I got closer to the mouth of the opening and called back. \n \"They have a queen to feed,\" Venturian said, \"and she is hungry.\" \n \n \n \n [1] In the elemental world, pilgrims are golems who have yet to choose their elemental body. They go on a \"pilgrimage\" when they wish to choose what form to embody by traveling across the colonies."

      "pages": [
        "Here, on planet Gogira, we encounter a world of giants. Everywhere you look, plants, creatures, land masses are of exaggerated size. The food chain is strictly adhered to, where the dragons sit at the top while everything else sits below them. Once uncontrollably violent, dragons nearly eradicated all living species on the planet. Being the only sentient species on Gogira they gradually realized the deficiencies of their behavior and have since cut back on their slaughter. Instead, they decided to cultivate the planet that they live on and care for the beasts that inhabit it. And while most dragons no longer wage war on every being they encounter, some give way to their primal instincts. It is thanks to the dragons' efforts that we can write about the Zeograth today. For the very first time, we will present a portrait of this enigmatic ",
        "creature that has fascinated explorers for years since Gogira's discovery. A carnivore, the Zeograth is a robust, clever, and dangerous animal, though the latter can be said of most Gogiran creatures. What makes it such a robust animal is its natural protective shell that sits on its back as well as its thick skin that has a high resistance to fire, clawings and chomps administered by even the toughest dragons, to a point. Not entirely a social animal, it hangs out in packs for efficiency's sake: it is easier for them to catch prey that way since they are on the smaller side on a Gogiran scale. But zeograths will even fight among themselves and wage clan wars, especially if there is food involved. Most packs are for life but if many members die, it is not uncommon for another pack to take in the zeograths left. On the other hand, before reaching ",
        "adulthood however, an infant zeograth is extremely vulnerable to the elements and the dangers around. With its protective shell still in development, its chances of survival from an attack are extremely low. For this reason, mother zeograths are strikingly  protective in the first five years of a zeograth's life. The following episode recounts such a phenomenon. What is the relationship between a mother zeograth and its kid?: Deep in the jungle, a mother and her kid walk along a hidden trail: today is bath day and they are on their way to the lake. It is rather rare for zeograths to travel alone like this, but this mother and her kid were recently separated from their pack after a surprise attack of a Green Carpenter - one of the most lethal spiders of its kind. This is why the mother is taking extra precaution. These thoughts probably ",
        "don't cross baby zeograth's mind; it bounces excitedly along its mother, jumping every now and again to playfully nip at her ears. Mother walks on, very much enjoying her little one's playful antics, but she must also keep an eye out for any lurking danger. In this merciless world, all it takes is one moment of distraction to end it all. The lake is teeming with creatures. This is no surprise: it is a hot and sunny day. Mother knew this ahead of time and planned her route leading to a little nook away from the others. Wyverns, carnivorous insects, dragons of all sorts, and other zeograths have also gathered at the lake today. And though everyone is here to enjoy a nice day by the water and basking in the sun, carnage is never too far. The zeograth mother stands close to her little one, acting as a shield to anyone who tries to harm her child. ",
        "Growing tired of its mother's protection, the energetic child plays around, splashing water about, swimming out in the deep end. It's begun to attract attention, and not the good kind. To communicate with each other, zeograths emit a modulated series of cries that closely resemble yelping. She wishes she didn't have to do this and attract more attention, but that is the only way she can communicate to her little one the urgency of coming back by her side. Exasperated by her child's disobedience, she decides to swim to it herself. With a short snap, she grabs its tail between her teeth and drags him back to shore. But they now have company: a hungry earthen dragon. Baby zeograth hides behind its mother while she menacingly growls. But she is at a disadvantage: there is no one else to help her. She also knows the dragon is too burly ",
        "and slow to catch her if she sprints away. Her timing must be impeccable and unpredictable. Before she can make a move however, the dragon swipes at her with its tail - she dodges it expertly. When he does it again, this time she is ready: she sinks her teeth into the tail, crushing its scales and bursting blood vessels. The Zeograth's secret weapon is their ability to lock their jaws onto any limb after which they secrete a venom that incapacitates their enemy. According to scientists, this fast acting venom creates blood clots, thus dramatically reducing blood circulation, often resulting in heart failure. She alone cannot kill this dragon given its size, but it will destabilize it for the time being. The child has now ran away to take shelter behind a boulder by the water. But what is that faint rumble in the distance? It is a pack of ",
        "zeograths arriving at the scene! Without so much of a thought, they throw themselves on the dragon, latching onto any available surface. Finally the mother can let go and must be relieved now that the others have taken over. In no time at all, the dragon stumbles and falls to the ground, its head landing with a splash on the shore. And just like that: lunch is served. Thankfully, mother and baby survived to see another day though the mother is injured and too tired to get up. One of the other zeograths from the pack, noticing the mother lying on the ground with her kid sitting next to her, brings over a chunk of flesh for them to eat. They have officially joined a new pack."
